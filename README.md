# Micro Reddit

A simple rendition of Reddit where users can post links to articles and then comment on them. This is the absolute barebones one can be to get my chops down on using Rails. There is even a super basic sign in/sign up functionality that doesn't use passwords, but I just added it to mess around with users posting things.

Probably won't be returning to this ever again, but it cemented some knowledge of Rails in my head.
